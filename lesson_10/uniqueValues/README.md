Write a function called countUniqueValues which accepts a sorted list and counts the unique values in the list. There can be negative or positive numbers in the list, but it will always be sorted.


# Test Cases
print(countUniqueValues([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2])) # 2
print(countUniqueValues([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 7, 7, 12, 12, 13])) # 7
print(countUniqueValues([-2, -1, -1, 0, 1])) # 4
print(countUniqueValues([])) # 0

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
