Write a function called maxSubListSum which accepts a list of positive integers and a number called num. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the list.


# Test Cases
print(maxSubListSum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 2)) # 10
print(maxSubListSum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 4)) # 17
print(maxSubListSum([4, 2, 1, 6], 1)) # 6
print(maxSubListSum([4, 2, 1, 6, 2], 4)) # 13
print(maxSubListSum([], 4)) # None

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
