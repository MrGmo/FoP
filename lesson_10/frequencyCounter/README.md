Write a function called same, which accepts two lists. The function should return true if every value in the first list has it's corresponding value squared in the second list. The frequency of values must be the same.


# Test Cases
print(same([1, 2, 3], [4, 1, 9])) # true
print(same([1, 2, 3], [1, 9])) # false
print(same([1, 2, 1], [4, 4, 1])) # false (must be same frequency)

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
