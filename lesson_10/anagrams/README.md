Given two strings, write a function that determines if the second string is an anagram of the first. An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.


# Test Cases
print(validAnagram('aaz', 'zza')) # false
print(validAnagram('anagram', 'nagaram')) # true
print(validAnagram('rat', 'car')) # false
print(validAnagram('qwerty', 'qeywrt')) # true

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
