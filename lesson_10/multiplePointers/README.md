Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted list of integers. The function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return a list that includes both values that sum to zero or -1 if a pair does not exist.


# Test Cases
print(sumZero([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3])) # [-3, 3]
print(sumZero([-10, -5, 0, 1, 3, 5, 87, 99])) # [-5, 5]
print(sumZero([-2, 0, 1, 3])) # -1
print(sumZero([1, 2, 3])) # -1

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
