Write a **recursive** function named is_decreasing that takes as its parameter a list of numbers.  It should return True if the elements of the list are strictly decreasing but return False otherwise. Strictly decreasing means that each element is **less** than the preceding one - **not** less than or equal. You can assume the array contains at least two elements.

You may use default arguments and/or helper functions.

Your recursive function must **not**:
* use any loops
* use any variables declared outside of the function
