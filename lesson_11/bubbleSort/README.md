Write a function called bubbleSort that takes in an unordered list of integers and sorts them in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.


# Test Cases
print(bubbleSort([5, 3, 10, 6, 1])) # [1, 3, 5, 6, 10]
print(bubbleSort([100, 98, 101, 10])) # [10, 98, 100, 101]
print(bubbleSort([2, 1, 0, 5, 4])) # [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
