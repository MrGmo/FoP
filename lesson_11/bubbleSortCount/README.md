Write a bubble sort function that counts the number of comparisons and the number of exchanges made while sorting a list and returns a tuple of the two values (comparisons first, exchanges second).


# Test Cases
print(bubbleSortCount([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7])) # (21, 1)
print(bubbleSortCount([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])) # (45, 45)
print(bubbleSortCount([2, 1, 0, 5, 4])) # (10, 4)
