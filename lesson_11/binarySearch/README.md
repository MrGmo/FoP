Write a function called binarySearch which accepts a sorted list and a value. It should return the index at which the value exists, otherwise, return -1. You should use the binary search algorithm.


# Test Cases
print(binarySearch([5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 18, 30, 34, 35, 37, 40, 44, 64, 79, 84, 86, 95, 96, 98, 99], 10)) # 2
print(binarySearch([5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 18, 30, 34, 35, 37, 40, 44, 64, 79, 84, 86, 95, 96, 98, 99], 95)) # 16
print(binarySearch([5, 6, 10, 13, 14, 18, 30, 34, 35, 37, 40, 44, 64, 79, 84, 86, 95, 96, 98, 99], 100)) # -1

Give the Time and Space Complexity of your solution as well.
