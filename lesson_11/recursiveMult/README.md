Write a **recursive** function named multiply that takes two positive integers as parameters and returns the product of those two numbers (the result from multiplying them together). Your program should not use multiplication - it should find the result by using addition. To get your thinking on the right track:

7 * 4 = 7 + (7 * 3)
7 * 3 = 7 + (7 * 2)
7 * 2 = 7 + (7 * 1)
7 * 1 = 7
So, 7 * 4 = 7 + (7 + (7 + (7)))

**Your code must not contain any loops.**
