Build a replica of the to-do-list pictured in the todolist.jpeg using HTML, CSS, and JS. Feel free to use the CSS framework Bootstrap as well, the getting started docs are here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/

* You will be working with Bootstrap during our immersive program so it's best to famililiarize yourself with it now.

Your to-do-list should be able to CRUD:
- Create a to-do (look into the form element, might help)
- Read a to-do
- Update a todo (have a strikethrough on completed to-do's)
- Delete a todo (a delete trash can button would be nice)

If you complete this to-do-list see if you can have your to-do's persist by placing them in local storage. This is meant to mimic what you will eventually do with a database.

**Avoid copying any of the to-do-list tutorials online, remember you need to escape tutorial hell if you hope to be a great dev**
