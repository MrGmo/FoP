Write a function named file_sum that takes as a parameter the name of a text file that contains a list of numbers, one to a line, like this:

23.77
116
94
-12.8
0
14.999

The function should sum the values in the file and write the sum (just that number) to a text file named sum.txt. If the function can't find the file containing the list of numbers throw a FileNotFoundError.
