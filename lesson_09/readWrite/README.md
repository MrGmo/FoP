1. Write code that opens a file named "Mary.txt" and writes to that file the first four lines of the nursery rhyme "Mary had a little lamb", with each line being written on a different line of the file. Now write code that opens that file and reads it, printing out each line as it goes. Use strip() to strip off the newline characters.


2. Create a dictionary that maps the numbers 1-13 to the names: William, Patrick, Jon, Tom, Peter, Colin, Sylvester, Paul, Chris, David, Matt, Peter, and Jodie. Write code that writes this dictionary to a JSON file and reads it as well.
